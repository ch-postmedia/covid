Cases have been reported at five more care facilities around Metro Vancouver, while outbreaks have been declared over at five other sites.</div>
		<div>Quebec is reporting 1,072 new cases of COVID-19 and 19 additional deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus. The province says there are four public long-term care homes and nine private seniors residences where more than 25 per cent of residents have COVID-19. Montreal is the epicentre of the virus in Canada, with almost 40,000 cases.</div>

		<div>Visitor restrictions, which were loosened in the summer after months of effective lockdown, have been reimposed at seniors facilities across Saskatchewan as COVID-19 transmission rises. Visits are allowed only for “compassionate reasons.”</div>

		<div>Rapid COVID-19 tests will soon be available at the Calgary airport and a United States border crossing in Alberta. If travellers take the tests, they will not have to quarantine for the required 14 days. If they test negative, they will be allowed to leave quarantine if they promise to get a second test on the sixth or seventh day after their arrival. The pilot project begins Nov. 2.</div>
		<div>Some developments across the country you may have missed last night
</div>
		<div>British Columbia has hit another daily record high with 274 new COVID-19 infections. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry social gatherings such as weddings and funerals are the cause of much of the spread. Henry says she doesn’t want to tighten restrictions but will if the situation gets worse.</div>
		<div>Chances are slim that restaurants in Montreal and Quebec City will be allowed to reopen this month, Premier Francois Legault said Thursday. The cities have been under a 28-day partial lockdown since Oct. 1. Legault told reporters that with the province reporting around 1,000 new cases of COVID-19 a day, the odds are low that some lockdown measures will be lifted.</div>
		<div>A union is calling for a pork processing plant southeast of Quebec City to close after 40 workers tested positive for COVID-19. One worker died Wednesday after testing positive the day before. Plant owner Olymel says it’s unclear whether the worker’s death was caused by the novel coronavirus.</div>
		<div>Manitoba health officials announced the deadliest day of the pandemic Thursday with four deaths caused by COVID-19 as more restrictions are being brought in for the capital city and the north. Forty-seven people in Manitoba have died, the vast majority in recent weeks.</div>
		<div>More than two dozen flights carrying COVID-19-infected passengers landed at Toronto Pearson International airport during the past two weeks. Online records posted by Health Canada show that since Oct. 5, 16 international and nine domestic flights touched down at YYZ carrying people with COVID infections.</div>
		<div>About 30 per cent of non-essential surgeries in the Edmonton zone will be postponed for the foreseeable future in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Alberta chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said cases are growing despite the voluntary measures introduced two weeks ago to slow the spread.</div>
		<div>The number of COVID-19 cases in Indigenous communities across Canada is still rising. There were 160 new cases reported for each of the two weeks leading up to Oct. 17. There have been 1,000 confirmed positive cases on First Nations reserves since the pandemic began, including 25 cases in Nunavik, in northern Quebec.</div>
